This document outlines some of the upcoming plans for React Native. Since React Native is a fast-moving project with a large amount of community contribution, this roadmap doesn't include everything that will go into React Native.

The React Native roadmap can be broken down into three key priorities: adding functionality to the core libraries, improving the core performance and stability of React Native, and making the developer experience better.

## Core Libraries

_Stay tuned..._

## Core Performance

_Stay tuned..._

## Developer Experience

_Stay tuned..._

Thanks to all the individuals and companies helping out with the projects on this roadmap!
